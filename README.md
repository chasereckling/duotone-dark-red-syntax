# DuoTone dark-red

A fork of simurai's duotone-dark-syntax theme.

A double-hue syntax theme for Atom.

DuoTone dark-red uses only 2 hues (red and orange) and 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

### Currently tested and optimized for these languages:

- C
- CSS
- CoffeeScript
- GF Markdown
- Go
- HTML
- JSON
- (La-)TeX
- Less
- Perl
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby

More optimization to come..
